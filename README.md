#lispr
lispr is a Ruby implementation of Lisp. As of right now, it is mostly an
unfinished implementation based on McCarthy's original Lisp, but hopefully will be
able to work seemlessly with Ruby classes and objects eventually

Some basic concepts, such as the structure of the reader, were adapted from
programble's similar project[lispy](http://github.com/programble/lispy).

It was a great help in getting a working draft produced fairly quickly.
